Ah, good question!

  For the Kanban project itself (the one with the dashboard    
   I'm connecting to):

  ❌ No need to tell me - The integration will keep working    
   regardless

  ✅ Why it's resilient:
  - I connect to your SQLite database directly (app.db)        
  - Database schema is stable (boards, columns, cards,
  checklist_items)
  - Even if you add new UI features, API endpoints, or
  dashboard improvements, the core database structure stays    
   the same

  🔧 Only tell me if:

  - You change the database schema (add/remove columns,        
  rename tables)
  - You move the database file to a different location
  - You want me to use new features you've added (like new     
  API endpoints)

  🎯 Otherwise:

  Your Kanban improvements (better UI, new features, bug       
  fixes) won't break our integration. I'm just
  reading/writing the same database your dashboard uses.       

  The integration is designed to be independent of your        
  Kanban project's evolution!

  Keep coding freely on both projects! 🚀
